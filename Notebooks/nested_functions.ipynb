The `echo` function takes an argument `n` and returns the `inner_echo` function. This is an example of a closure in Python.\n\nAs explained above a closure is a nested function that remembers the state of its enclosing scope when called. In this case, the `inner_echo`function has access to the `n` variable from its enclosing scope, even after the `echo` function has finished execution.\n\nThe `inner_echo` function takes a single argument `word1` and concatenates `n` copies of `word1`. The `echo` function returns the `inner_echo` function, which can then be called with a string argument.\n\nWhen we call `echo(2)`, it returns a new function `twice` that has `n`set to 2.\nSimilarly, when we call `echo(3)`, it returns a new function `thrice` that has `n` set to 3.\n\nFinally,we call `twice('hello')` and `thrice('hello')`, which return 'hellohello' and 'hellohellohello', respectively.

This allows the nested function to access and modify the value of the variable from its enclosing scope. The `nonlocal` keyword is used when you want to assign a new value to a variable in an outer (but non-global) scope.\n\nOn the other hand, the `global` keyword is used to indicate that a variable is a global variable, which means it is accessible from anywhere in the code, not just within the function or block of code where it is defined. When you use the `global` keyword before a variable, it tells Python that the variable is a global variable and should be accessible from any part of the code.\n\nHere's an example to demonstrate the difference between `nonlocal` and `global`:\n\n```python\ncount = 0  # Global variable\n\ndef outer_function():\n    count = 10  # Enclosing scope variable\n\n    def inner_function():\n        nonlocal count  # Refers to the count variable in the enclosing scope (outer_function)\n        global count  # Refers to the global count variable\n        count += 1  # Modifies the count variable in the enclosing scope\n        print(\"Enclosing scope count:\", count)\n\n    inner_function()\n\nouter_function()\nprint(\"Global count:\", count)","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"75580fdb-e9c3-46f3-bff8-a1307ddb0902"},{"source":"Below we'll take a deep dive into the `nolocal` keyword and how to use it with nested functions.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"58d17cd2-f1eb-4858-8e05-e4583524daa8"},{"source":"# Define echo_shout()\ndef echo_shout(word):\n    \"\"\"Change the value of a nonlocal variable\"\"\"\n    \n    # Concatenate word with itself: echo_word\n    echo_word = word + word \n    \n    # Print echo_word\n    print(echo_word)\n    \n    # Define inner function shout()\n    def shout():\n        \"\"\"Alter a variable in the enclosing scope\"\"\"    \n        # Use echo_word in nonlocal scope\n        nonlocal echo_word\n        \n        # Change echo_word to echo_word concatenated with '!!!'\n        echo_word = echo_word + '!!!'\n    \n    # Call function shout()\n    shout()\n    \n    # Print echo_word\n    print(echo_word)\n\n# Call function echo_shout() with argument 'hello'\necho_shout(\"hello\")","metadata":{"executionTime":167,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Define echo_shout()\ndef echo_shout(word):\n    \"\"\"Change the value of a nonlocal variable\"\"\"\n    \n    # Concatenate word with itself: echo_word\n    echo_word = word + word \n    \n    # Print echo_word\n    print(echo_word)\n    \n    # Define inner function shout()\n    def shout():\n        \"\"\"Alter a variable in the enclosing scope\"\"\"    \n        # Use echo_word in nonlocal scope\n        nonlocal echo_word\n        \n        # Change echo_word to echo_word concatenated with '!!!'\n        echo_word = echo_word + '!!!'\n    \n    # Call function shout()\n    shout()\n    \n    # Print echo_word\n    print(echo_word)\n\n# Call function echo_shout() with argument 'hello'\necho_shout(\"hello\")"},"cell_type":"code","id":"88c65d35-961b-49f7-897a-5b8bb49075f4","execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"hellohello\nhellohello!!!\n"}]},{"source":"In the given code, we have a nested function `shout` defined inside the `\necho_shout` function.
